			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I have learned more from life than from traditional school. I recommend to others to always explore and to help contribute to the world around them to make it a better place for everyone. I enjoy using Linux, FOSS software, and telling others about these projects. I've very grateful that these projects present us with great modern-day choices.</p>
